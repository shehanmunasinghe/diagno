The first source is the **public and unused data from the China Physiological Signal Challenge in 2018 (CPSC2018)**, held during the 7th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology in Nanjing, China. The unused data from the CPSC2018 is NOT the test data from the CPSC2018. The test data of the CPSC2018 is included in the final private database that has been sequestered. This training set consists of **two sets of 6,877 (male: 3,699; female: 3,178) and 3,453 (male: 3,453, female: 1,610)** of **12-ECG** recordings **lasting from 6 seconds to 60 seconds**.

This database consists of **75 annotated recordings** extracted from 32 Holter records. Each record is **30 minutes long** and contains **12 standard leads**, each sampled at **257 Hz**.\n","\n","3. The third source from the **Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)** comprises **two public databases: the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database and the PTB-XL**, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset. The first **PTB database** contains **549 records (male: 377, female: 139)**. Each recording was sampled at **1000 Hz**. The **PTB-XL** contains **21,837** clinical 12-lead ECGs **(male: 11,379 and female: 10,458)** of **10 second length** with a sampling frequency of **500 Hz**.\n","\n","4.
